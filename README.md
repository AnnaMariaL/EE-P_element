# OVERVIEW

- **data/experimental-evolution/**: Contains the time-resolved P-element CN estimates for the 1st and 2nd wave experimental evolution study. 
gen = generation; replicate = evolutionary replicate ID, CN = P-element copy number estimate per haploid genome (software used: DeviaTE)

- **data/simulations/**: Contains simulated training (n=1,000), validation (n=5,000) , and test data (n=5,000) for surrogate modeling using Gaussian Processes. Simulations were run until the P-element was lost, or for 120 generations. Note that only evolved time-points that were sequenced in the empirical study were used for statistical emulation. GEN = generation;	trans_prob = transposition probability (*u* in manuscript); N_per_line	= number of flies used from each isofemale line to initialize the simulation (= 5); sel_alpha = alpha parameter of beta distribution determining selection coefficients for P-elements;	sel_beta = beta parameter of beta distribution determining selecfion  coefficients for P-elements;	l_pi = piRNA cluster size (scaled to percent (min = 0, max = 1) for Gaussian processes, *f_regulatory* in manuscript);	p_te = probability of isofemale line carrying the P-element (*p_carrier* in manuscript);	id = simulation ID;	q025 = 2.5th percentile of P-element copy number per haploid genome across *n* simulation runs;	q050 = median P-element copy number per haploid genome across *n* simulation runs;	m = mean P-element copy number per haploid genome across *n* simulation runs (used for Gaussian Process training);	q0975 = 97.5th percentile of P-element copy number per haploid genome across *n* simulation runs;	cv = coefficient of variation for P-element copy number per haploid genome across *n* simulation runs;	n = number of simulation runs conducted per parameter combination;
  
- **src**
    - **IBM**: Contains individual-based models implemented in SLiM4 simulating P-element invasions in experimental *Drosophila simulans* populations.
        - IBM-1st/2nd-wave.slim: Individual-based models used for the main analysis (5 model parameters)
        - IBM-1st/2nd-wave-extended.slim: Extended individual-based models including additional model parameters for the dominance coefficient *h*, and the excision probability *v* for a transposing P-element. 
    - **GPs**: Contains 2 jupyter notebooks demonstrating the usage of Gaussian Processes. Specifically the training of multi-task GPs (*training* directory) and parameter tuning with the trained GPs (*parameter-tuning* directory). For demonstration purposes only â€” please adjust global variable names and directory structure before attempting to use this code.

- **GPs/**: Contains trained GPs for 1st ("early") and 2nd ("established") wave.
    - *.pth = model snapshots during model training (n = 40); Each model snapshot was evaluated against a validation dataset to determine the optimal amount of training.
    - stats-GP.txt = overview of GP performance during training: invasion_type = type of EE experiment;	round = snapshot;	training_loss = loss on training data;	training_rmse	 = root mean square error on training data; validation_rmse = root mean square error on validation data;	neg_count_val = number of negative copy number predictions on validation data
    - P-GP-predict.tct = predictions of GP for test data set; refer to **data/simulations/** for column descriptions. Additional columns: pred = predicted P-element copy number per haploid genome using the trained GP; lower = lower limit 95 % credible interval (not informative to this study); upper = upper limit 95 % credible interval (not informative to this study);
