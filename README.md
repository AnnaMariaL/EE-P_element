# README

This repository accompanies the following preprint: "Purifying Selection Shapes the Dynamics of P-element Invasion in Drosophila Populations"

This repository contains:
- time-resolved P-element CN estimates
- individual-based simulation models implemented in SLiM4
- simulation data
- trained GPs
- Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the usage of GPs 

# OVERVIEW

**data/experimental-evolution/** 
Contains the time-resolved P-element CN estimates for the 1st and 2nd wave experimental evolution study. 
gen = generation; replicate = evolutionary replicate ID, CN = P-element copy number estimate per haploid genome (software used: DeviaTE)
