# ReadMe 

This repository contains time-resolved P-element CN estimates, individual-based simulation models implemented in SLiM4, simulation data, trained GPs, and Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the usage of GPs accompanying the following preprint: "Purifying Selection Shapes the Dynamics of P-element Invasion in Drosophila Populations"

# Overview

*data/experimental-evolution/*txt:* Contains the time-resolved P-element CN estimates for the 1st and 2nd wave experimental evolution study. gen = generation; replicate = evolutionary replicate ID, CN = P-element copy number estimate per haploid genome (software used: DeviaTE)
