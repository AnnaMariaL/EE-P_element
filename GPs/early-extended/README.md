This directory contains:

- Model snapshots (*.pth): Saved states of the trained Gaussian Process (GP) model.

- Training statistics (stats-GP.txt): Metrics and performance logs from the model training process.

- Test predictions: Model outputs for test data.

These files correspond to the GP model trained on an extended individual-based P-element invasion model, designed to replicate conditions of the first-wave experiment.
